# Test that `run-example-tests` exits with success when expected and, more importantly, that it
# exits with an error on failure. This test does not use the enyx-regtest framework for the pretty
# obvious reason that if a bug were to cause the framework to ignore errors, this test might then
# fail to properly report errors as well.
